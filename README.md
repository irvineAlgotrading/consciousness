use up arrow on keyboard to introduce a positive response from the environment
use down arrow to introduce a negative response
hold the key for the length of introduction
error is assumed to minimize logarithmically over time
when states maximize and continue being ramped, they sometimes reset.  i find this interesting.

please reach out if you would like to understand more, essentially it attempts to find balance and use its outputs with weights to interact with its environment and internal self.  as states of mind shift and are affected, the effected relevant states are proportionally affected.

i'm pretty floored by how similar the response is and the growth and recuperation patterns that emerge in response to inputs.

once the interface with its environment can be multimodal models, chains can be setup inbound and outbound to interact with whatever it is set up to interact with.
