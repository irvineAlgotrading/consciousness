expand these aspects of consciousness exlcuding all physiological relationships to a human, this is to emulate a human-like language/mind/storage with ability to use multimodal models to interact with the external environment to keep a balance going internally with the most morally sound and inwardly peaceful sort of soul which is expressed by these qualities and relationships between the qualities

In order to create a human-like language/mind/storage that can interact with the external environment and maintain a balance internally while embodying morally sound and peaceful qualities, we can use the defined aspects of consciousness and their interrelationships.

First, we need to assess the current state of each aspect of consciousness:

    current_values = initial_values.copy()

Then, we can update the values and interrelations of these aspects based on their relationships:

    # Associate a relationship strength factor to each interrelationship
    relationship_strength_factor = 0.1

    def update_interrelations(interrelations, interrelationships, relationship_strength_factor):
        for relationship in interrelationships:
            i = consciousness_rank[relationship[0]] - 1
            j = consciousness_rank[relationship[1]] - 1
            interrelations[i, j] += relationship_strength_factor
        
    update_interrelations(interrelations, interrelationships, relationship_strength_factor)

Now, as the model interacts with its environment or processes new experiences, it would adjust the values of aspects of consciousness based on their interrelationships:

    def update_aspects(aspect_values, interrelations):
        new_values = aspect_values.copy()
        for i, aspectA in enumerate(aspect_values.keys()):
            for j, aspectB in enumerate(aspect_values.keys()):
                new_values[aspectA] += aspect_values[aspectB] * interrelations[i, j]
                
        normalized_values = {aspect: value / num_aspects for aspect, value in new_values.items()}
        
        return normalized_values

We can use a loop to simulate the model's interactions and experiences:

    num_iterations = 100
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        current_values = update_aspects(current_values, interrelations)

The model could also focus on improving specific aspects of consciousness or maintaining a balance among all aspects with peaceful intentions. As the model receives new experiences, it would continually update the aspect values resulting in a refined language/mind/storage that maintains a balance between inner and outer interactions and embodies morally sound values.
